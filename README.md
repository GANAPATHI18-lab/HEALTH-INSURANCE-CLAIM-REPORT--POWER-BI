# HEALTH-INSURANCE-CLAIM-REPORT--POWER-BI
Project Description:

This Power BI project provides an end-to-end analytical view of health insurance claims, covering financial performance, provider distribution, coverage patterns, demographic insights, and global claim behavior. The dashboard brings together multiple datasets—claims, members, providers, hospitals, payments, and geographic data—to deliver powerful insights for insurers, analysts, and healthcare operations teams.

The report enables users to explore:

Claim amounts and approval trends

Provider and member distributions across hospitals

Coverage-level claim behavior (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum)

Net payments vs billed amounts

Geographic claim distribution across 90+ countries

Degree & gender distribution of providers

Monthly, hospital-wise claim activity

Drill-down claim traceability using a decomposition tree

Designed with interactive visuals, filters, and drill-through actions, this dashboard supports data-driven decision-making across claims processing, provider management, and insurance product optimization.
